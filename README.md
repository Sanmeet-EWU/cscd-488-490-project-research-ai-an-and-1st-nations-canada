Project Overview: The Understanding of Trauma and Reconciliation with Research for AI/AN and First Nations Canada project is a WordPress-based website developed to serve as a resource hub for students, researchers, and community members. It provides scholarly research links, multimedia resources, and user-submitted feedback to facilitate discussions on trauma and reconciliation within AI/AN and First Nations communities. The website does not use a traditional database but instead relies on WordPress content management features to organize and store multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio files. User feedback is collected through GravityForms, where responses are securely stored in the Forms Tab for review.

Installation Instructions: As the project is hosted on EWU’s WordPress infrastructure, there is no separate installation package. All modifications and updates must be made directly through WordPress, which is managed by the Eastern Washington University IT Department. Authorized users can log in to inside.ewu.edu and access the WordPress dashboard. From there, they can edit content, manage multimedia in the Multimedia Tab, and review feedback stored in the Forms Tab through GravityForms. Any new access requests or technical support inquiries must be directed to the EWU IT Department.

Usage Details: The website serves as a research and educational platform, allowing users to explore scholarly articles, multimedia resources, and community discussions. Visitors can access research links, view images and videos, and submit feedback through the online feedback form, with responses securely stored for review by the website editor. A walkthrough video demonstrating the website’s features, including content management and feedback handling, is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/owzdgk9xuRQ
