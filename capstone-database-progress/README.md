For the AI/AN capstone project, we've been working with WordPress. Due to the limitations of WordPress, we do not necessarily have our own created "database", instead we use the functionality of the implemented management system to track the images, videos and audios we're using. Through our walkthrough video, you'll have the opportunity to see how that system is set up for us and how we call those medias on the page when we add them in. Currently, we are still looking for more media to store and allow our sponsors to decide what items they want to use so that we have a means to make use of this provided system. 

We have included a csv that we are able to download from WordPress with all the information we would get back from the feedback page. This is just one example use of the system that we have tried out.

Below is the walkthrough video of our WordPress website. Due to limitation of the upload size on github, we have uploaded the video to YouTube and the video link is provided below.
